This is my first assignment in my coding bootcamp.  For this assignment, we are tasked to edit the codebase that follows accessibility standards and optimize it for search engines.  To do this, we will give our HTML better syntax, add alt attributes to img elements, and review the CSS style sheet that is linked to the page.

The following is what I hope to accomplish:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

I am also using w3schools.com as a reference for Semantic HTMLs.  Here is the link:
